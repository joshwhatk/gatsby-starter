### A Little About Us
We met at the age of 13 at Josh’s home church ⛪️ (imagine wallpaper, blue carpet and wine colored chairs&mdash;straight up 90s! 😆) Engaged at 17 and married at 19, we now have 3 beautiful girls that inspire us daily! 👧🏻👧🏻👧🏻🎀

When our oldest was just a toddler, it was difficult for us to find parenting advice that truly reflected God’s heart towards family. It was either too “fluffy” ☁️ or too harsh ⚡️. So we looked to the Bible to see what God (the perfect Parent!) had to say, and as it turns out, He has a lot to say on the subject! 🙌🏼

Whether it’s discipline, picky eating, or just how to enjoy life, we’ll talk about it!🎙 We believe that when you stop focusing on all the RULES👨🏻‍⚖️ and start focusing on the RELATIONSHIP 💖, you can begin to build the culture that you want in your family.

Do we have all the answers?? Ha! No. 😂 But this is parenting from the trenches. We’ll talk about what we’re going through, and what we have learned. 💡
We’ll give it to you raw & real. 👊🏼 We are here with you growing and learning everyday! ✨

As parents, we should come alongside each other, not attacking one another. We should encourage, through grace and love, and not settle for an average, mediocre life.

When you work hard, love much, and pray often, your future looks AWESOME!
